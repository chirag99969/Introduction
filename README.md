# Introduction

Cloud Security/Cyber Security Professional with 13 plus years across domains Cloud Security, CSPM, CWPP, AWS, Azure, GCP, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), 
Threat Detection and Response, Detection Engineering, Threat Research, Security Operations,  Endpoint Security (EPS), Endpoint Detection and Response, Network security, 
Network Access Control, Content filtering, Isolation and sand-boxing, Identity and Access management (IDAM). 

I am extremely tech savvy, Cloud Security Engineer, I have got Expertise level of Experience with AWS/Azure/GCP Cloud providers, I have implemented plethora of cloud native services at scale, for AWS, I have implemented Guardduty, Security Hub, AWS Congfigs, Organiational Cloudtrail Logging, Cloudwatch Logs and Metrics for observability, Service Control Policy, IAM, Identity Center, Security Automation using Lambdas, Event Brigde, implemented Logging and Monitoring for AWS Services at scale in SIEM, implemented falco for EKS Workloads, deployed Splunk SIEM as Kubernetes Workloads, did Vulnerability Management, SBOM using opensource project Scancode, syft.

I have led and done CSPM, CWPP, CNAPP, red teaming projects for cloud using cloud native tooling, third party tools like Prisma Cloud/Crowstrike and Open source tools as well. Managed IAM, SCP, Security Boundaries, network segmentation on cloud,  Onboarding Apps to SSO.

## Strengths
Proficiency/Expertise with AWS/Azure/GCP Services, Cloud Security, CSPM, CWPP, SIEM, EDR, IAM, SSO, Network Security, Security Automation, Security Boundary, Network Segmentation, Monitoring and Observability, POC and Deployment of Security Tooling, Vulnerabilty Management, SBOM, CI/CD security.

## Projects I worked upon: 

* CSPM for AWS/GCP : Accomplished CSPM (Cloud Security Posture managemenet) successfully for AWS (200 plus accounts) and GCP (15 plus) using Prisma Cloud. Using config, event, network
queries, written 200 Detections (Policies, ALert Rules). Integrated with email Notification, Team channels, XSOAR (Demisto) platform to create Notables. 
Prepared documentation for SOC analyst to triage. 

* AWS Cleanroom : Created AWS Cleanroom, Terraform apply to spin up. It instantiates Windows machine (loaded with DFIR Tools, 
Windows Collection tools, windows analysis tools) and Linux cleanroom (we use mobaXterm to login), once logged in, we can use REMnux/Linux tools, including GUI tools
like Wireshark. For persistent storage, data from cleanroom can be dumped to S3 bucket. To tear down Cleanroom, terraform destroy. 

* Offensive Terraform/Attack Simulation : Written Terraform modules for 20 plus AWS services to create misconfigured resources to check the efficacy of CSPM effort.
This has become a mothly periodic exercise to check the efficacy of CSPM (Policies, rules), we have for detecting misconfigs. 

*RedTeaming on AWS : Conducted RED teaming exercise using open source projects cloudgoat and pacu to determine our Cloud security posture. With cloudgoat created
resources on AWS, assumed the case compromised keys, did enumeration using pacu modules and eventually exflitrated credentials for every new IAMUser created. 
Intention was to determine, how many detections triggered using our current technology stack (prisma Cloud, Splunk Analytics, Guardduty, Vectra). 
And how successful are we, what can be improved upon further. 


Typical Day at work looks like (when in call/shift)  
👉 Detection Engineering 👉 Align TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK framework 👉 Incident Response 👉 Bring about remediations 👉 Attack Simulation 
👉 Validate our detection rules 👉 Threat Hunting 👉 log analysis 👉 playing with big datasets 👉 Innovate and Improve 👉 Repeat

* Cloud secuirty : 
* AWS: Expertise level of proficiency
* Azure/GCP : Moderate Proficiency

Good at analysing and parsing large datasets (all security, cloud data sources).Extremely adept at doing proof of concepts for new security technology stack, testing integrations. 


Skilled in Cyber Risk and security, peer Mentoring, training employees, technical leadership, group Discussions, and ITIL Processes.
